/**
 * State-free commodity applicability — "does obligation X apply to
 * commodity NAME C?".
 *
 * Answers the question a page must ask BEFORE any record exists (which
 * identifier fields to render for a picked commodity, which CYA rows a
 * line's commodity earns), so runtime scope (`makeScope`) cannot answer
 * it. Sourced from the manifest's gate metadata: the commodity-gated
 * helpers expose their allowlist on `applyTo.metadata.values` in the
 * stored picker-name vocabulary, so the stored commodity compares
 * directly.
 *
 * `notInUnionOf` gates (the free-text identifiers) are complements: they
 * apply exactly when the commodity is NOT in the derived union. Every
 * other shape applies when the commodity is in the list; an obligation
 * with no commodity gate never applies here.
