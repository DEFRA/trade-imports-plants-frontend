/**
 * notInUnionOf — dual of `allowListed`. Obligation is in scope on
 * entries whose `gateObligation` stored value is NOT in the union of
 * the given allowlists. The derived union is computed when the gate
 * runs and exposed on `.metadata.values` so static analysis (witness
 * synthesiser, browser-side controllers) can inspect "would this value
 * be admitted?" without executing the closure.
 *
 * Two input shapes accepted:
 *   - `[[a, b], [c, d]]` — a list of allowlists (typical case:
 *     `notInUnionOf(gateField, [allowlistA(), allowlistB(), allowlistC(),
 *     allowlistD()], nestedCollection, reasons)`). The union is set-like
 *     — duplicates across allowlists collapse.
 *   - `[a, b, c]` — a flat list of values (single-allowlist complement).
 *     Ergonomic shorthand; the derived union is just the input.
 *
 * Rationale — `notInUnionOf` as a derived-union helper over
 * `.metadata.values` is STRICTLY better than a hand-restated
 * four-allowlist complement expressed as an opaque JS predicate: adding
 * a fifth value to one of the source allowlists widens the derived union
 * automatically; a hand-restated complement would silently double-gate
 * if the author forgot to add a fifth `!X.includes(value)` conjunct.
 *
 * Shares the outer factory in `internals/build-projection-gate.js`
 * with `allowListed`. Only the predicate direction (not-in-union vs
 * in-list), the values source (derived union vs plain list), and the
 * metadata `type` string differ.
