/**
 * ObligationEvaluator.
 *
 * Pure sync evaluator over the flat, composite-key `fulfilments` map.
 * See obligations.md for the model and FULFILMENT_SHAPES.md for storage
 * examples.
 *
 * Constructed once per Service; each `evaluate(fulfilments)` call is
 * pure. The obligations manifest is injected at construction.
 *
 * Scope resolution: every obligation with an `applyTo` receives
 * `applyTo(fulfilments, fulfilmentIndexesByObligationId)` where the second
 * arg is a `Map<obligationId, string[]>` of currently-present
 * group-instance-paths, enumerated pre-purge from raw storage. This
 * lets gated obligations look up their parent-group's instance-paths
 * without enumerating storage themselves — see `helpers.js` for the
 * common gate shapes (`allowListed`, `allowListedByPredicate`,
 * `branchedGate`, `anyAllowListed`).
 *
 * Algorithm per call:
 *
 *   1. Drop unknown obligation ids (tolerate-and-amend).
 *   2. Converge on the post-purge view via fixpoint iteration:
 *      repeat {enumerate group paths → evaluate `applyTo` →
 *      compute effective inScope → purge storage} until the
 *      fulfilments map stops changing. Every `applyTo` is thus
 *      exercised against the same post-purge view all other gates
 *      see — a value this call is purging cannot silently drive
 *      another gate. Bounded by `MAX_PURGE_ITERATIONS` for safety;
 *      convergence typically hits in 1-2 iterations for real
 *      manifests because `purgeStorage` is monotonic (never adds).
 *   3. Post-purge enumeration for group implications.
 *   4. Build per-obligation implications (category-specific shape;
 *      groups/leaves carry a `records` array).
